    start_year: 2004
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The original BMW 1 Series was offered in hatchback (E87 five-door, E81 three-door), coupe (E82), and convertible (E88) body styles. It was notable for being the only rear-wheel drive vehicle in its class, featuring naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines ranging from four-cylinder to six-cylinder configurations. The 1 Series brought BMW's driving dynamics to the compact premium segment. This generation replaced the BMW 3 Series Compact as the entry-level model in the BMW range. The high-performance 1 Series M Coupé was also available in this generation."

    end_year: 2019
    description: "The second-generation 1 Series continued as a rear-wheel drive hatchback offered in three-door (F21) and five-door (F20) body styles. The range included models from the efficient 114i to the high-performance M135i/M140i with up to 340 HP. This generation introduced turbocharged engines across the range, and added more technology including BMW's iDrive system. A facelift in 2015 significantly updated the styling and interior. The coupe and convertible models were spun off into the 2 Series."

    end_year: 2024
    description: "The third-generation F40 1 Series marked a significant shift for the model, adopting a front-wheel drive architecture based on BMW's UKL2 platform. Available exclusively as a five-door hatchback, it offered improved interior space and packaging efficiency compared to its predecessors. Engine options included turbocharged three-cylinder and four-cylinder units. The front-wheel drive configuration with an all-wheel drive option represented a major departure from earlier rear-wheel drive generations. BMW worked to maintain engaging driving dynamics through sophisticated chassis tuning and electronic systems."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (F70)"
    start_year: 2024
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation F70 1 Series was officially unveiled on 4 June 2024 and represents a heavy refresh of the F40 rather than a complete redesign. It continues to use the front-wheel drive based UKL2 platform and is available exclusively as a five-door hatchback. Engine options continue with turbocharged three-cylinder and four-cylinder units, with the M135i featuring enhanced performance. Despite its different internal codename, the F70 shares significant continuity with its F40 predecessor while incorporating modern styling updates and enhanced technology features including digital instrumentation and advanced driver assistance systems."
